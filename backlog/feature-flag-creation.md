# Feature: Create Feature Flag

## Overview

We need a way to create a new feature flag in the system. A feature flag should have a name, a short description, and be either enabled or disabled.

### Details

- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  - Presents a form to create a feature flag (name, description, enabled/disabled).
  - Validates input on the client side and sends a POST request to the backend API.
- **Backend (Express):**
  - **Routes:** Receives the request and delegates to the controller.
  - **Controller:** Validates the request using Zod, handles errors, and calls the service.
  - **Service:** Contains business logic for creating a feature flag, checks for uniqueness, and interacts with the data access layer.
  - **Data Access Layer (Prisma):** Handles all database operations using the Prisma client singleton.
- **Database:**
  - Stores feature flag records with name, description, and enabled/disabled state.

#### Data Flow

1. User submits the create feature flag form in the UI.
2. Frontend sends a POST request to the backend API.
3. Backend validates and processes the request through controller and service layers.
4. Service layer interacts with the Prisma data access layer to create the record in the database.
5. Backend returns success or error response to the frontend.
6. Frontend updates the UI based on the response.

#### Vertical Slice Implementation

- Each feature (like feature flag creation) is implemented as a vertical slice, including:
  - Frontend UI components and API calls
  - Backend route, controller, service, and validator
  - Database schema and access logic
- This ensures all layers are covered for the feature, from UI to database, with clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Create a Feature Flag

**As** a product manager or developer
**I want** to create a new feature flag with a name, description, and enabled/disabled state
**So that** I can control the rollout of features in the application

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Add a New Feature Flag

- **Actor:** Product manager, Developer
- **Precondition:** User is authenticated and has permission to manage feature flags
- **Main Flow:**
  1. User navigates to the feature flags management page
  2. User clicks on 'Create Feature Flag'
  3. User enters a unique name for the flag
  4. User enters a short description (optional or required)
  5. User sets the flag as enabled or disabled
  6. User submits the form
  7. System validates the input and creates the feature flag
  8. User sees the new flag in the list
- **Postcondition:** The new feature flag is available for use in the system

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must allow creation of a feature flag with the following fields:
   - Name (required, unique, non-empty)
   - Description (required, short text)
   - Enabled/Disabled (boolean, required)
2. If the name is not unique or is empty, the system must show a validation error.
3. The description must be a short text (e.g., max 255 characters).
4. The enabled/disabled state must be clearly settable at creation time.
5. Upon successful creation, the new flag appears in the feature flags list.
6. All validation errors are shown to the user in a clear and actionable way.

## Notes

- This feature is foundational for feature flag management and will be extended with editing, deleting, and targeting rules in future stories.
