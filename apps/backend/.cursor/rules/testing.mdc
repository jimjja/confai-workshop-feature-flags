# Testing Rule

## Overview
- All business logic and components must have unit tests.
- Use Jest as the consistent testing framework across all apps and packages.
- Place tests in a dedicated `tests/` directory, using camelCase and ending with `.test.ts`.
- Prefer testing public APIs over internal implementation details.
- Ensure tests are fast, reliable, and isolated from external dependencies.

## Prisma Unit Testing
- Use mocked prisma client in `mocks/`
- Do not use a real database in unit tests; mock all Prisma calls and set return values as needed.
- In tests, always mock Prisma return values with the correct types (e.g., use `Date` objects for `createdAt`/`updatedAt`).

## Best Practices
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks.
- Mock external dependencies and services.
- Keep test files and functions small and focused.
- Use code coverage tools to monitor test completeness.
- Review and update tests as features evolve.
