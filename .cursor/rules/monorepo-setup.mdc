- Use a monorepo structure with separate apps under `apps/` (e.g., `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`).
- All apps should live under `apps/`.
- Use a single package manager (npm) for all apps.
- Use a root `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig` for consistency.
- Use root-level scripts for common dev tasks (e.g., `npm run lint`, `npm run format`).
- Keep documentation up to date in the root `README.md`.
- Use Docker Compose for local development and service orchestration (if needed).
- Use consistent naming conventions for apps.
